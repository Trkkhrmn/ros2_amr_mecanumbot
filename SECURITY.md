# Security

If you think you found a security issue, please report it privately instead of opening a public Issue.

1. **Contact:** Use the maintainer email in the `package.xml` files, or the repo owner’s contact from their GitHub profile.
2. Describe the issue briefly (what it is, which part is affected, how to reproduce).
3. We’ll try to respond quickly and may publish a fix or advisory.

This project is for simulation and research; if you use it on real hardware, take extra safety measures.
